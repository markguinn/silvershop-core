for users
==========================

This documentation is intended to provide enough information for a store owner to
use the default eCommerce module installation.

Before you use this documentation, it is highly recommended that you get up to speed with the
[SilverStripe CMS documentation](http://userhelp.silverstripe.org/)  first.
You should also talk with your website developer to know if the standard eCommerce system has been
modified in any way.
