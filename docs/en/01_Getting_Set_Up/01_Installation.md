Currently you must use [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install the shop module. Composer will handle installing module/library dependencies for you automatically. Composer does require some basic knowledge of the terminal, and git. Take the time to learn composer, as it will benefit you greatly as a PHP developer.

In a terminal window, in the website root, type:
```sh
composer require burnbright/silverstripe-shop "*"
```

## Configuration Options

The `example_config.yml` file gives an exhaustive list of the possible configuration options within the shop module.

See the [customisation](../02_Customisation) section of this documentation or more advanced customisations.
