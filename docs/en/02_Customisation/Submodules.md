# Shop Sub-Modules

Sub-modules provide additional functionality that remains separate from the main shop module to keep the core code as minimal as possible. If you are creating custom/different functionality for your website, and it could be used on other sites, then you should put this code into a submodule.

See the README file for a list of some known submodules, or search in the relevant places:

[silverstripe addons](http://addons.silverstripe.org/add-ons?search=shop), or [packgist](https://packagist.org/search/?q=silverstripe%20shop), or [github](https://github.com/search?q=silverstripe+shop).

If you are interested in contributing your own sub-module(s), see [contributing](Contributing.md) docs.
